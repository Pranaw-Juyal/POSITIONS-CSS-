# POSITIONS-CSS

In this we will be learning about various position properties in CSS , i.e :-
      ⚡ static - default position (means that position cannot be changed in this even if u set top right z-index etc positions)
      ⚡ relative - element is relative to itself (top , right , z-index will work in this)
      ⚡ absolute - positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (removed from the flow)
      ⚡ fixed - positioned relative to the browser (removed from the flow) / (is used for nav bar and footer fix position)
      ⚡ sticky - positioned based on the user's scroll position
